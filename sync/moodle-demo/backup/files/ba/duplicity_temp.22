<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>This course is based on the idea of explaining something to those who knows nothing at all. When someone outside asked about something it's never a good idea to directly explain the detailed part, nor explain from the very beginning chronically until end, but an explanation like an overview is expected. Even an overview is still not quite on the target, instead it is an explanation that the questioner must understand. It should be something like an easy definition, provided with few common examples, and how it could relate to the questioner.Â </span><br /><br /><span>The course title itself is called "Taking The First Step" are for those who wants to start into a subject. If it is asked in which level does this course reside, it resides before introduction. Before taking a formal class of introduction to a subject, this course may act as preliminary where a person may decide to learn about a certain course or not. You may call it a synopsis, blurb, summary, or maybe back of the book cover. This course have to be easily understandable by everyone, leaving all the difficult topic out, while giving a picture to the learners of what the subject is. Then the could tackle the introduction.</span></p>
